<h3><em>Twenty years of schooling...</em></h3>
<p>Thanks for visiting! I'm Max. I grew up in Hagerstown, Maryland in the foothills
of Appalachia. After taking a <a href="https://www.heraldmailmedia.com/education/assembly-at-north-hagerstown-high-honors-seniors/article_2b18a4c6-8cd1-58fd-b675-1c51c2c57ce4.html">programming</a> class in High School, I realized that I had finally found
something that I could enjoy doing for a while.</p>
<p>In my college application process, I found myself between <strong>THE</strong> Ohio State University
and *ichigan. I thankfully wound up going to the one with better
CSE <a href="http://www.winsipedia.com/ohio-state/vs/michigan">technical electives</a>. While at Ohio State, I enrolled in the <a href="https://eed.osu.edu/feh-overview">FEH</a>
program in my freshman year. Following that I was a UTA for 3 years through the end of my undergrad.
I was then given the incredible opportunity to become a <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/a5/Grand_Theft_Auto_V.png">GTA</a>
where I continued to teach Freshman the fundamentals of being an engineer.</p>
<p>Additionally I was in charge of the robot controller team in the FEH program.
We maintained and updated the Proteus, which was a K60 Freescale SOC with I2C, SPI,
UART, and lots of various GPIO functionality. We maintained an API for students to use
when designing their robots for the annual <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BT_4bZT1ABk">FEH Robot Competition</a>, which was the
culmination of a semester-long team-based design project.</p>
<p>I've now wrapped up my educational experience and will soon graduate with my Master's in CSE.</p>
<h3><em>...And they put you on the day shift</em></h3>
<p>I learned a lot about embedded software while working on the Proteus team, and I
realized that I really enjoy the unique nature of problems presented by embedded
software development. This led me to get a <a href="https://rebble.io/">Pebble</a> smartwatch,
which was the second embedded platform that I wrote code for. I created two watchfaces
(one of which can be seen on the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/597507018/pebble-2-time-2-and-core-an-entirely-new-3g-ultra/posts/1752929">final</a>
update that Pebble ever made) and got some fun experience with basic memory management
and API referencing!</p>
<p>I then made a list of embedded companies that would be at the Ohio State career fair.
I talked with and subsequently interview with Texas Instruments, and was brought on for an internship in Dallas!
I help convert a legacy Perl tool into a fully configurable C++ application for <a href="https://www.ti.com/design-resources/design-tools-simulation/webench-power-designer.html">Webbench</a> in my first internship. I was in a software development role,
but I wanted to get closer to the hardware. I was offered an internship in driver
development in San Diego with TI. There, I helped develop a security layer for OAD for the BLE team.</p>
<h3><em>Headin' out for the old east coast, lord knows I paid some dues gettin' through...</em></h3>
<p>I heard that TI had an office out in Germantown, Maryland. I wanted to try and work my
way back towards my family out east, so I took an internship there on the radar board test team.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there wasn't a full-time position available on that team. However,
I was given the opportunity to join the Sitara Application Development team full-time.
I'm in TI's rotational program for that role where I've helped design and implement customer-facing
sample applications and documentation.</p>
<h3><em>...But me, I'm still on the road A-heading for another joint</em></h3>
<p>And that's as far as I got! I'm interested in embedded software development for my career.
My hobbies include <a href="/images/tri.jpg">triathlons</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/4propphotographymk/">drone photography</a>, travel,
<a href="/images/cast-iron.jpg">cast-iron cooking</a>, <a href="/images/baking.jpg">baking</a>, and <a href="/images/paddle.jpg">paddle boarding</a>.</p>
<p>Additionally, I really enjoyed my time teaching, and I'm looking to find a way to
continue that passion in STEM education.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading!</p>
